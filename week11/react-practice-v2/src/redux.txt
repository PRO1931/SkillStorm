Redux?

- Redux is a state management solution for React
- Stores the application's state globablly in a "State store"
- Helps avoid "prop drilling"
- "Prop drilling" is the act of passing props down multiple levels to child components
    even though most of those components do not care about the prop, they just forward it onward
- Similar to useContext

Flux Pattern:
- Used by Redux and follows this general procedure

1. An event is triggered (ex. user interaction on button click, or form submit)
2. An action is dispatched to update the viw of the webpage
3. Reducers receive the action and update the state inside the global store
4. Any components using that particular state are rerendered with the new state
5. The view is updated

Works in an Observer design pattern/ Publisher-Subscription (Pub-Sub) way
- Anything subscribed to a particular state will be notified when that state changes
- Similar to a mailing list that you subscribe to

What data should be stored in Redux?
- Don't just add everything to the store
    - State that is component specific should be local state to that component
    - ex. Counter count, form data
- Redux should store "application data"
    -Data that is used across the entire application
    - Network data that is being pulled by a web server
- Try to distinguish between component data and application data
    - If the data is only to be used locally in a single component, it probably shouldn't go in the store
